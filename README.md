Simulator of Radar Tracking

Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I was able to build this basic radar interface. Moving targets with signal strength in dBm are shown. To select a target and check its details, click on it. 
You can add new targets by entering their name and selecting "Add Signal." The interface features a green radar-style design, a system log, and a live UTC clock.

To use it, download or duplicate the project, then open a web browser and open the index.html file.

And don't forget to enjoy this project!
